	<p>This page is strongly inspired by one of my friend. Since this page is just for fun, 
	I suggest you skip it quickly and do not waste much time on it if you have some affairs more important
	to do on hand.</p>
	<p>Here is <a href="https://guchenlin.blogspot.com/">my blog</a>. Its birth comes from one debate with one
	friend. He thought I just give a lot comments to the others' rather than running a proper blog. Thus I 
	decided to run my own blog as a counter-attack. Time proves it hard to always keep writing (interesting) ideas,
	but I try my best.</p>   
	<p>You can find me (easily?) in the following videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1agseoOoQO8">X - a magic world</a>,
	<a href="http://www.tv5monde.com/emissions/episode/destination-francophonie-destination-x-l-ecole-polytechnique">X - TV5Monde</a>,	
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwoFdfIxUVA">IHES - a temple of maths and physics</a>,
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee04r3d6TBk">Ali - maths</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>In 2019, I am qualified in the final of the Alibaba maths competition sponsored by Jack Ma. It is a nice memory and 
	another video touched me so much during the ceremony <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av45016307?from=search&seid=16178416153134018730">A running Pi</a>.
	It seems that we became superstars that week and we appeared in many interviews and reports, but in fact I am only a random walker attempting to solve some maths problems.
	</p>   
   <p>Finally, let mention <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wqy/">the guy</a> who teaches me a lot. We have once 
   trained for maths olympiad in high school and also collaborated for (maybe) my first paper. 
   I always remember the epoch when I was younger and those friends with who we studied maths together. 
   I missed the old days, but perhaps to do maths is the only way to keep them in my mind. </p>
